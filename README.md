### 🧠 About Me
I came into the programming world to **build hard things**.

You will find me in the obscure world of learning **old stuff** and things that aren't relate with my position (example: **LISP**, **ASM**).  
But, who cares? it's fun 😎

But reality is harder than that and i can't always learn old stuff —  
I also have to stay up to date with the newest trends in **Frontend**, **Backend**, **System Design**, and every framework of **JS** that claims to be *the one and truly all-you-need* ⚔️

### 🎓 Background
I studied **Software Development at ITLA**, but most of my knowledge comes from reading books on:  

- Programming Language  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Concurrency & Parallelism  
- System Programming  
- Networking  
- System Architecture  
- System Design  
- Operating Systems  
- Databases (SQL and NoSQL)

### 💻 Technologies I’ve Used in Production
- The one and only **JavaScript** (which brings us to **NodeJS**, **ReactJS**, **AngularJS**, **TypeScript**, **ExpressJS**, **NextJS**, **NestJS**) — give a strong clap 👏  
- **Go** — I love this one!  
- **C** — I haven't shipped anything to production, but built tons of side projects and POCs with it (and wanted to show off 🙃).  
- **Python**  
- **NGINX**  
- **Windows**, **MacOS**, **Linux**: **Ubuntu** & **Arch** (Do I look smart now? No? Okay. At least I tried 😅)  
- **AWS**, **Azure**, **Render**  
- **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, **Elasticsearch**
